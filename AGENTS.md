# Agent Notes

## Project Shape
- Single-package Vite React app; use `pnpm` because `pnpm-lock.yaml` is the committed lockfile.
- App entry chain is `index.html` -> `src/main.tsx` -> `src/App.tsx`.
- `src/App.tsx` owns board orchestration, drag/drop, keyboard handlers, reducer dispatch, and playtest-log console output; keep leaf components in `src/components/` mostly presentational.
- `src/game/` is the domain layer: `types.ts` defines state shape, `setup.ts` creates/shuffles decks and initial board state, `rules.ts` decides stacking/completion legality, `effects.ts` handles pending rewards, and `state.ts` wires reducer updates to playtest log events.
- Gameplay mutations should flow through `BoardUpdater`/`gameReducer` in `src/game/state.ts`; use `withPlaytestEvents` plus event builders in `src/game/logEvents.ts` when an action should appear in the playtest log.
- Initial setup shuffles with `Math.random()` in `src/game/setup.ts`; do not assume deterministic card/deck order in checks.
- Keep `PROTOTYPE_USER_MANUAL.md` updated when gameplay design changes, including setup counts, card rules, rewards, game loop, controls, and win/loss conditions.

## Commands
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`.
- Start dev server: `pnpm dev`.
- Production verification: `pnpm build` runs `tsc -b && vite build`.
- Focused typecheck: `pnpm exec tsc -b`.
- Lint all files: `pnpm lint`; focused lint: `pnpm exec eslint src/path/file.tsx`.
- Preview a successful build: `pnpm preview`.
- No test runner, test script, CI workflow, formatter config, or pre-commit hook is currently configured; do not invent `pnpm test` as verification.

## Toolchain Quirks
- TypeScript uses project references from root `tsconfig.json`; app code is included only from `src`, and `vite.config.ts` is covered by `tsconfig.node.json`.
- `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` enable `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, and `erasableSyntaxOnly`; avoid unused symbols and TypeScript constructs that require runtime emit such as enums or parameter properties.
- ESLint ignores only `dist` and applies JS recommended, TypeScript recommended, React Hooks, and React Refresh Vite rules to `**/*.{ts,tsx}`.
- CSS in `src/App.css` uses native nesting and `color-mix()`; preserve the nested style unless there is a specific reason to flatten it.
